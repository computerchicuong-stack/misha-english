Mis HÃ  English - Landing page demo
Files:
- index.html
- style.css
- data.js  <-- Edit this file to update schedule, students, news
- script.js
- images/logo-demo.png
- images/banner.jpg

How to update content:
1. Open data.js in a text editor (or Notepad).
2. Edit the arrays: schedule, students, news.
   - For students, change name, subject, score (number), note.
3. Save the file and re-upload to GitHub (or refresh the page if running locally).

Deploy on GitHub Pages (quick):
1. Create a GitHub repo (public), e.g., misha-english
2. Upload all files and folders (index.html at repo root)
3. In repo Settings -> Pages -> Choose branch 'main' and root folder -> Save
4. GitHub will provide a URL like: https://<your-username>.github.io/misha-english

If you want, I can also give step-by-step screenshots for GitHub Pages deployment.
